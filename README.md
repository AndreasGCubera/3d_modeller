# 3d_modeller
 
This small Python project will be the first cohesive code where I make full use of the tools and techniques I've learned this past weeks via "Dead Simple Python", by Jason C. McDonald. 

I'll be using Erick Dransch's "500 Lines or Less" 3D Modeller project as reference (https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-3d-modeller.html) to make my own functional 3D Modeller, building on his work and trying to improve my own Python knowledge in the process. 

I'll make use of GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) and Legacy OpenGL throughout the project, and will also try to analyze the efficiency and speed of my code, so I can make it as optimal as possible.
